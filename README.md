# **Breast Cancer Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning**

## **Project Overview**
This project applies **machine learning models** to predict breast cancer survival outcomes using structured clinical data. By leveraging different classification algorithms, we assess **predictive accuracy, feature importance, and model interpretability** to support oncologists in identifying high-risk patients.

## **Project Stages**
This project consists of the following stages:

1. **Literature Review**  
   - Analyzed past research on breast cancer survival prediction models.  
   - Identified key clinical features influencing survival outcomes.  

2. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Used structured patient data containing tumor size, receptor status, lymph node involvement, etc.  
   - Applied feature encoding, missing data handling, and class balancing (SMOTE).  

3. **Model Development & Evaluation**  
   - Trained **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks**.  
   - Evaluated performance using **Accuracy, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC**.  
   - Identified key predictive factors using **SHAP values and feature importance**.  

4. **Survival Analysis & Case Studies**  
   - Integrated **Kaplan-Meier survival analysis** to validate ML model predictions.  
   - Added **real-world case studies** to demonstrate clinical applicability.  

5. **Ethical Considerations & Future Work**  
   - Addressed **data privacy, model interpretability, and bias mitigation**.  
   - Proposed **integration with Electronic Health Records (EHRs)** for real-world use.

   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Navigate to** `/notebooks/` and execute the scripts step by step.

## **Results Summary**
- **Random Forest achieved the best performance** with **93.62% accuracy**.  
- **Tumor size, lymph node involvement, and hormone receptor status were key predictors.**  
- **Deep learning models performed well but required more computational power.**  

## **Future Improvements**
- **Enhance interpretability** using **explainable AI (SHAP values, LIME).**  
- **Expand dataset** by integrating genomic and treatment-related data.  
- **Deploy as a web application** to allow oncologists to use predictions interactively.
